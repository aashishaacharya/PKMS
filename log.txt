# PKMS Development Log

## Log Entry #1 - 2025-06-24 11:30:00
**Phase**: Backend & Authentication Implementation
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Successfully implemented complete backend infrastructure with authentication system for PKMS.

### Changes Made
1. **Database Infrastructure**:
   - Created SQLAlchemy async setup with proper session management
   - Implemented all database models (User, Session, RecoveryKey, Note, Document, Todo, Project, DiaryEntry, DiaryMedia, Tag, Link)
   - Added proper relationships and foreign keys
   - Implemented database initialization and cleanup

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Created centralized configuration system with environment variable support
   - Added settings for database, security, file storage, and CORS
   - Implemented proper path resolution for data directories

3. **Authentication System**:
   - Implemented secure password hashing with bcrypt and salt
   - Created JWT token management for authentication
   - Added session management with auto-expiration
   - Implemented password recovery system with security questions
   - Added password strength validation
   - Created secure session tokens and recovery keys

4. **API Endpoints**:
   - User setup (first-time password creation)
   - User login/logout
   - Password change
   - Recovery setup and password reset
   - User information retrieval
   - Setup completion

5. **Security Features**:
   - Strong password requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
   - Secure session management with 30-minute auto-logout
   - Password recovery with security questions
   - JWT token authentication
   - Proper error handling and validation

### Files Created/Modified
**Backend Structure**:
- `pkms-backend/app/__init__.py` - App package
- `pkms-backend/app/config.py` - Configuration management
- `pkms-backend/app/database.py` - Database setup and session management
- `pkms-backend/app/models/` - All database models
- `pkms-backend/app/auth/` - Authentication system
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/auth.py` - Authentication endpoints
- `pkms-backend/main.py` - Updated main application

**Database Models**:
- `user.py` - User, Session, RecoveryKey models
- `note.py` - Note model with tags and links
- `document.py` - Document model for file management
- `todo.py` - Todo and Project models
- `diary.py` - Encrypted diary entries and media
- `tag.py` - Tag model for cross-module organization
- `link.py` - Cross-module linking system

### Testing Status
✅ Backend container builds successfully
✅ Database tables created automatically
✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
✅ All directories created properly
✅ Authentication system ready for testing

### Next Steps
- Test authentication endpoints with frontend
- Implement remaining API modules (Notes, Documents, Todos, Diary)
- Create frontend authentication components
- Add encryption for diary content

### Technical Notes
- Using SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support
- JWT tokens for authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- SQLite for local-first approach
- Docker containerization working properly
- All security best practices implemented
