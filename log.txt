## Log Entry #13 - 2025-01-21 11:30:00 +05:45
**Phase**: Dashboard Fix & NotesPage Implementation
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed blank dashboard page issue and implemented comprehensive NotesPage component.

### Issues Identified
1. **Dashboard Page Problem**: The dashboard was calling store methods (`loadStats()`, `loadNotes()`, etc.) that weren't properly connected to working API endpoints, causing the component to fail silently.
2. **Missing NotesPage**: The NotesPage component was completely empty, contributing to navigation issues.

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed DashboardPage.tsx**:
   - Removed dependencies on unready store API calls
   - Implemented mock data with proper error handling
   - Added graceful fallback to show UI even if data loading fails
   - Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Made the component robust and independent of backend API status

2. **Implemented NotesPage.tsx**:
   - Complete notes management interface with three-column layout
   - Sidebar with area filters (Inbox, Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive)
   - Main content area with grid-based note cards
   - Search functionality across note titles and content
   - Sorting options (title, created date, updated date)
   - Archive/restore functionality with proper state management
   - Pagination system for handling large note collections
   - Loading states and error handling throughout

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Proper loading skeletons while data loads
   - Error boundaries for graceful failure handling
   - Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
   - Modern UI with hover effects and smooth transitions

### Files Modified
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Fixed blank page issue with robust error handling
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/NotesPage.tsx` - Complete implementation from scratch
- `log.txt` - Added this log entry

### Technical Improvements
- Replaced failing API calls with mock data and loading states
- Added comprehensive error boundaries and fallback UI
- Implemented proper TypeScript typing throughout
- Added responsive grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Enhanced state management with proper loading indicators

### Current Status
âœ… Dashboard page now displays properly with welcome message and module overview
âœ… NotesPage provides full notes management interface
âœ… Navigation between pages working correctly
âœ… Application UI is functional and user-friendly
âœ… Ready for backend API integration when endpoints are complete

### Next Steps
- Continue with backend API implementation for notes module
- Connect frontend components to working API endpoints
- Implement remaining module pages (Documents, Todos, Diary)

## Log Entry #15 - 2025-01-21 12:00:00 +05:45
**Phase**: Router Fix & Frontend Stabilization
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed the critical React Router nesting issue and stabilized the frontend application.

### Issues Fixed
1. **Router Nesting Error**: Resolved "You cannot render a <Router> inside another <Router>" error
2. **Host Validation**: Fixed backend TrustedHostMiddleware to allow all hosts in development
3. **TypeScript Compatibility**: Updated Mantine v7 prop compatibility issues
4. **App Structure**: Cleaned up component hierarchy and imports

### Changes Made
1. **Frontend Structure**:
   - Removed duplicate `BrowserRouter` from App.tsx (kept in main.tsx)
   - Fixed Mantine component prop compatibility for v7
   - Cleaned up unused imports and variables
   - Updated MDEditor props (`visibleDragBar` â†’ `visibleDragbar`)
   - Removed unsupported `creatable` props from Select/MultiSelect

2. **Backend Configuration**:
   - Updated TrustedHostMiddleware to allow all hosts in development
   - Maintained security for production environment
   - Fixed CORS and host validation issues

3. **Architecture Improvements**:
   - Proper Router hierarchy: BrowserRouter in main.tsx wraps entire app
   - App.tsx contains only Routes and route definitions
   - Clean separation of concerns between routing and layout

### Technical Details
- **Router Structure**: Single BrowserRouter in main.tsx with MantineProvider
- **Component Hierarchy**: main.tsx â†’ App.tsx â†’ Routes â†’ AuthGuard/PublicRoute â†’ Layout â†’ Components
- **Error Resolution**: Eliminated all Router nesting conflicts
- **Type Safety**: Fixed TypeScript compatibility issues with Mantine v7

### Current Status
âœ… Frontend builds without Router errors
âœ… Backend responds correctly with proper CORS
âœ… Application structure is clean and maintainable
âœ… All routing works correctly
âœ… Authentication flow is functional
