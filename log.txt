2. **Host Validation**: Fixed backend TrustedHostMiddleware to allow all hosts in development
3. **TypeScript Compatibility**: Updated Mantine v7 prop compatibility issues
4. **App Structure**: Cleaned up component hierarchy and routing structure

### Root Cause Analysis
The primary issue was having **two `BrowserRouter` components**:
- One in `main.tsx` wrapping the entire app
- Another in `App.tsx` wrapping the routes
This violated React Router's architecture and caused the application to fail.

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed Router Architecture**:
   - Removed duplicate `BrowserRouter` from `App.tsx`
   - Kept single `BrowserRouter` in `main.tsx` with `MantineProvider`

   - Updated `TrustedHostMiddleware` in `main.py`
   - Added development environment check
   - Allows all hosts (`["*"]`) in development mode
   - Maintains security for production environment

3. **Mantine v7 Compatibility**:
   - Fixed `visibleDragBar` → `visibleDragbar` prop name
   - Removed unsupported `creatable` props from Select/MultiSelect components
   - Updated `data-color-mode` prop to use undefined instead of "auto"
   - Cleaned up unused imports and TypeScript errors

4. **Component Structure Cleanup**:
   - Removed unused imports in Layout.tsx
   - Fixed NotesPage integration with proper routing
   - Enabled all route definitions in App.tsx
   - Proper AuthGuard and PublicRoute implementations

### Technical Implementation
- **Router Structure**: Single BrowserRouter → MantineProvider → App → Routes

## Log Entry #17 - 2025-06-25 23:45:00 +05:45
**Phase**: Critical Backend Hot-fix & Build Pipeline Update
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Resolved backend startup failure (`AttributeError: 'property' object has no attribute 'schema'`) caused by a name clash between a custom `metadata` property in `ArchiveItem` model and SQLAlchemy's internal `metadata`. Backend now boots successfully and `/health` returns 200 OK. Re-enabled SQLAlchemy 2.x after confirming version was not the root cause.

### Root Cause
`ArchiveItem` declared a property called **`metadata`**. During declarative class construction SQLAlchemy expects `metadata` to be its own `MetaData` instance; the custom property masked it, leading to the crash.

### Fix Implemented
1. **Model Refactor** (`pkms-backend/app/models/archive.py`)
   • Renamed property to `metadata_dict` and adjusted getter/setter.
   • Added runtime alias `metadata` → `metadata_dict` (post-class-creation) for backward compatibility.
2. **Requirements** (`pkms-backend/requirements.txt`)
   • Restored `sqlalchemy[asyncio]==2.0.23` (the problem was name collision, not version).
3. **Container Rebuild**
   • Re-built `pkms-backend` image and restarted containers – backend healthy.

### Files Affected
- `pkms-backend/app/models/archive.py`
- `pkms-backend/requirements.txt`

### Verification
- `docker-compose logs pkms-backend` shows successful table creation & health checks.
- `GET http://localhost:8000/health` returns **200 OK** with status *healthy*.

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any runtime errors from alias usage.
- Audit other models for reserved attribute names. 

## Log Entry #18 - 2025-06-26 10:15:00 +05:45
**Phase**: Front-end Runtime Bug Fix & UI Component Update
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed a front-end runtime error that prevented the React app from loading due to missing exports in the generated Vite bundle:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module .../@tabler_icons-react.js does not provide an export named 'IconMood'
```
Additional TypeScript errors were thrown when Mantine v7 `Calendar` API was used with the deprecated `value/onChange` props.

### Root Cause
1. **Icon Export Mismatch** – `IconMood` has been renamed in the latest `@tabler/icons-react` package.  
2. **Mantine v7 API Change** – `Calendar` no longer accepts `value`/`onChange`; selection must be handled via `getDayProps`.

### Fix Implemented
1. **`DiaryPage.tsx`**  
   • Replaced `IconMood` with `IconMoodSmile`.  
   • Switched from the outdated `value/onChange` pattern to Mantine v7 compliant `getDayProps`.  
   • Added `isSameDay` (date-fns) helper for selection state.  
   • Ensured import path updated: `import { Calendar } from '@mantine/dates';`
2. **Dependency Check** – Verified no other components import `IconMood`; none found.

### Files Affected
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/DiaryPage.tsx`

### Verification
- `npm run dev` compiles with **0 errors / 0 warnings**.  
- Browser DevTools console clear; Diary page renders correctly.  
- All other routes tested – no regression.

### Next Steps
- Audit other Mantine components for API changes during v7 migration.  
- Update style guide docs with new icon naming conventions.
