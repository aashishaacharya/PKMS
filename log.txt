# PKMS Development Log

## Log Entry #26 - 2025-01-11 22:55:00 +05:45
**Phase**: Error Investigation & Prevention Measures
**Status**: ✅ INVESTIGATION COMPLETED

### Summary
Investigated the root causes of recent errors and implemented prevention measures. The main culprit was incomplete feature implementations during rapid development cycles, not malicious code.

### Error Pattern Analysis
1. **Missing Functions**: Auth store called non-existent API functions (`isTokenExpiringSoon`, `showExpiryWarning`)
2. **Unsafe Property Access**: Dashboard accessed nested properties without optional chaining
3. **Incomplete Features**: Configuration arrays referenced but not defined

### Root Cause
- **Incremental Development**: Features added in pieces without complete implementation
- **Insufficient Testing**: Changes made without proper validation
- **Missing Error Handling**: Lack of null checks and fallbacks

### Session Timing Clarification
- **Total Session**: 30 minutes (`access_token_expire_minutes: 30`)
- **Warning Triggers**: At 25 minutes (5 minutes remaining)
- **Extension Available**: One-click session extension via notification

### Prevention Measures Implemented
1. **Complete Feature Implementation**: All referenced functions now exist
2. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Added null checks and optional chaining throughout
3. **Proper Testing**: Functions tested before deployment
4. **Clear Documentation**: All features properly documented

### Files Fixed
- `pkms-frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Added missing token expiry functions
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx` - Fixed unsafe property access
- Multiple components - Added proper error handling and null checks

**Next Steps**: Implement more rigorous testing procedures for future development cycles.

## Log Entry #25 - 2025-01-11 22:50:00 +05:45
**Phase**: Token Expiry Warning System Implementation
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed critical "apiService.isTokenExpiringSoon is not a function" error by implementing a comprehensive token expiry warning system with session extension functionality. The error was occurring because the auth store was calling non-existent functions in the API service.

### Issues Resolved
1. **Missing Functions Error**: Fixed `apiService.isTokenExpiringSoon is not a function` error that was showing in console
2. **No Session Extension**: Users had no way to extend their sessions when tokens were about to expire
3. **Poor UX**: No user-friendly warning system for session expiry

### Technical Fixes Applied
1. **Added Token Expiry Detection**:
   - **Function**: `isTokenExpiringSoon()` - Checks if JWT token expires within 5 minutes
   - **Implementation**: Parses JWT payload to extract expiry time (exp field)
   - **Logic**: Returns true if token expires in less than 5 minutes but is still valid

2. **Implemented Warning System**:
   - **Function**: `showExpiryWarning()` - Shows user-friendly warning notification
   - **Features**: Orange warning notification with session extension button
   - **Prevents Spam**: Only shows warning once using `tokenExpiryWarningShown` flag
   - **Auto-Close**: Warning resets when user closes notification

3. **Added Session Extension**:
   - **Function**: `extendSession()` - Makes authenticated request to refresh session
   - **Implementation**: Calls `/auth/me` endpoint to trigger token refresh
   - **Success Feedback**: Green notification confirms session extension
   - **Failure Handling**: Red notification and automatic logout on failure

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - **401 Interceptor**: Automatically handles token expiry with logout
   - **Token Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of auth state and localStorage
   - **Auto-Redirect**: Redirects to login page on session expiry

### User Experience Improvements
- **Proactive Warning**: Users get 5-minute advance notice before session expires
- **One-Click Extension**: Single button click to extend session without re-login
- **Clear Feedback**: Success/failure notifications with appropriate colors and icons
- **Graceful Handling**: Automatic logout and redirect if extension fails
- **Prevents Data Loss**: Users can save work before session expires

### Technical Implementation Details
- **JWT Parsing**: Simple base64 decoding to extract expiry time (production-ready)
- **Custom Button**: Dynamically created extend button with hover effects
- **Notification Management**: Proper cleanup of notifications and flags
- **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Session Monitoring**: Integration with existing auth store session monitoring

### Files Modified
- `pkms-frontend/src/services/api.ts`: Added token expiry detection, warning system, and session extension

### Current System Status
- ✅ **Console Errors**: No more "function not found" errors
- ✅ **Session Monitoring**: Proactive 5-minute warning system working
- ✅ **User Experience**: One-click session extension available
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful session expiry and auto-logout

2. **Warning Notifications**: User-friendly orange warning with extend button
3. **Session Extension**: One-click session renewal without re-authentication
4. **Success Feedback**: Green confirmation when session extended successfully
5. **Failure Recovery**: Automatic logout and redirect on extension failure
6. **Spam Prevention**: Warning shown only once per expiry cycle

### Next Steps
- Monitor session extension usage and effectiveness
- Consider adding user preference for warning timing (5, 10, 15 minutes)
- Implement background session refresh for power users

**Phase**: Dashboard Critical Crash Fixes & Code Completion
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed critical dashboard component crashes caused by unsafe property access and missing configuration arrays. The dashboard was crashing with "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors when trying to access nested properties without proper optional chaining.

### Issues Resolved
1. **Unsafe Property Access**: Dashboard component was accessing `stats.notes.recent`, `stats.diary.streak`, and `stats.archive.items` without optional chaining, causing crashes when stats were null or undefined
2. **Missing Configuration Arrays**: The `quickActions` and `modules` arrays were referenced but not defined, causing "is not defined" errors
3. **Missing Helper Methods**: Dashboard referenced `dashboardService.getStreakStatus()` and `dashboardService.calculateCompletionPercentage()` methods

### Technical Fixes Applied
1. **Added Proper Optional Chaining**:
   - **Problem**: Line 569-573 had `stats.notes.recent === 0` without null checking
   - **Solution**: Changed to `(stats?.notes?.recent || 0) === 0` with proper optional chaining
   - **Impact**: Dashboard no longer crashes when stats are undefined or null

2. **Defined Missing Configuration Arrays**:
   - **Problem**: `quickActions` and `modules` arrays were referenced but not defined
   - **Solution**: Added complete configuration arrays with proper TypeScript interfaces

**Phase**: Frontend-Backend Communication Fix
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed critical frontend-backend communication issue where the frontend was making API calls to its own port instead of the backend server port.

### Issues Resolved
1. **Frontend API Configuration Error**: Frontend was using relative URL `/api` causing it to make requests to localhost:3000 instead of backend at localhost:8000
2. **404 Not Found Errors**: All authentication and API calls were failing with 404 errors

### Technical Fix Applied
1. **API Base URL Correction**:
   - **Problem**: `baseURL: '/api'` in `pkms-frontend/src/services/api.ts` was making relative calls to frontend port
   - **Solution**: Changed to `baseURL: 'http://localhost:8000/api'` to point to backend server
   - **Impact**: Frontend can now properly communicate with backend API

### Current System Status
- ✅ **Backend**: Running successfully on http://localhost:8000

**Phase**: Backend Startup Fixes & System Simplification
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed critical backend startup issues that were preventing both frontend and backend from running. Resolved SQLite database initialization errors and rate limiting middleware issues. Also documented previous system simplifications that were made.

### Issues Resolved
1. **SQLite Database Initialization Error**: Fixed "You can only execute one statement at a time" error
2. **Rate Limiting Middleware Error**: Fixed "State object has no attribute 'limiter'" error
3. **Backend Container Crashes**: Resolved startup failures that were causing container restarts

### Technical Fixes Applied
1. **Database Index Creation Fix**:
   - **Problem**: Multiple CREATE INDEX statements were being executed as a single SQL block, which SQLite doesn't support
   - **Solution**: Modified `pkms-backend/app/database.py` to execute each CREATE INDEX statement separately
   - **Impact**: Database initialization now completes successfully without SQLite errors

2. **Rate Limiter State Fix**:
   - **Problem**: SlowAPI middleware couldn't find the limiter object in app state
   - **Solution**: Added `app.state.limiter = limiter` in `pkms-backend/main.py`
   - **Impact**: Rate limiting middleware now works properly without AttributeError

### Previously Removed Features (Documented)
The following features were removed in previous sessions but not properly logged:

1. **python-magic Dependency**:

**Phase**: Critical Bug Fixes - SQLAlchemy FTS5 and Import Issues
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed critical backend startup issues caused by improper SQLAlchemy FTS5 configuration and missing imports that were preventing both backend and frontend from starting properly.

### Issues Identified
1. **SQLAlchemy FTS5 Error**: The `ArchiveItemsFTS` class in `archive.py` was using unsupported SQLAlchemy syntax for FTS5 virtual tables
2. **Missing Imports**: Optional dependencies (`fitz`, `DocxDocument`) were referenced but not properly imported with fallback handling
3. **Import Path Issues**: `archive_tags` table was being imported from wrong module causing circular dependency issues
4. **Foreign Key Mismatch**: Junction table column names didn't match the actual usage in the codebase

### Changes Made
1. **Fixed FTS5 Configuration**:
   - **Problem**: `ArchiveItemsFTS` class used unsupported `sqlite_fts5` argument causing "Argument 'sqlite_fts5' is not accepted by dialect 'sqlite'" error
   - **Solution**: Commented out the FTS5 virtual table implementation temporarily, added note that SQLAlchemy doesn't natively support FTS5 
   - **File**: `pkms-backend/app/models/archive.py`

2. **Added Missing Optional Imports**:
   - **Problem**: `fitz` and `DocxDocument` were referenced in text extraction functions but not imported
   - **Solution**: Added proper try/except import blocks for optional dependencies
   - **Files**: `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive.py`

3. **Fixed Import Path Issues**:
   - **Problem**: `archive_tags` was being imported from `app.models.archive` but defined in `app.models.tag`
   - **Solution**: Corrected import statements to import `archive_tags` from proper location
   - **Files**: `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive.py`, `pkms-backend/app/routers/archive_improvements.py`

4. **Fixed Junction Table Schema**:
   - **Problem**: `archive_tags` table used `archive_uuid` column but code expected `item_uuid`
   - **Solution**: Updated column name from `archive_uuid` to `item_uuid` in table definition
   - **File**: `pkms-backend/app/models/tag.py`

5. **Fixed SQLAlchemy Relationships**:
   - **Problem**: Direct import of `archive_tags` table object in relationship definitions
   - **Solution**: Changed to string-based reference to avoid circular imports
   - **File**: `pkms-backend/app/models/archive.py`

### Technical Impact
- **Backend Startup**: Fixed the SQLAlchemy argument error that was preventing backend from starting

## Log Entry #16 - 2025-07-02 12:05:00
**Phase**: Backend & Frontend Refactoring - Diary Module
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Completed a major refactoring of the Diary module to enhance security, flexibility, and performance. The new implementation encrypts the entire diary entry as a single JSON blob, resolving previous CORS/500 errors and providing a more robust foundation. This change also enables multiple entries per day.

### Changes Made
1. **Backend Refactoring**:
   - **Database Schema**: Redesigned the `DiaryEntry` model to store all data in a single `encrypted_blob` text field, removing individual encrypted columns.
   - **Table Reset**: Implemented logic to drop the old `diary_entries` and `diary_media` tables on startup to ensure a clean schema migration.
   - **API Rewrite**: Completely rewrote the `/api/v1/diary` router. The new API is simpler, more secure, and uses unique entry IDs for all operations instead of dates.
   - **Multi-Entry Support**: The API endpoint `GET /diary/entries/date/{entry_date}` now correctly returns a list of all entries for a given day.
   - **Error Fixes**: Permanently resolved the recurring 500 internal server errors (which appeared as CORS errors in the browser) by moving database migrations to the application startup sequence and fixing a logging configuration bug.

2. **Frontend Refactoring**:
   - **Service Layer**: Rewritten the `diaryService.ts` to align with the new backend API and single-blob encryption model.
   - **Data Structures**: Introduced a `DiaryData` interface for unencrypted content and updated `DiaryEntry` to match the new API response.
   - **Encryption Flow**: The frontend now stringifies a `DiaryData` object into JSON, encrypts it, and sends the resulting blob to the backend. The reverse happens for decryption.
   - **Code Cleanup**: Removed all obsolete methods and types related to media handling, stats, and templates from the service layer.

### Technical Implementation
- **Encryption Strategy**: Changed from field-by-field encryption to encrypting a single JSON object. This improves security and simplifies adding new fields in the future.
- **Database Migration**: Handled via a drop-and-recreate strategy on application startup for a clean transition.
- **API Design**: The API is now more RESTful, using unique IDs for resource manipulation, making it more predictable and robust.

### Files Modified
- `pkms-backend/app/models/diary.py`: Redefined `DiaryEntry` model.
- `pkms-backend/app/database.py`: Added logic to drop old diary tables.
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/diary.py`: Complete rewrite of the diary API.
- `pkms-backend/main.py`: Cleaned up migration logic.
- `pkms-frontend/src/services/diaryService.ts`: Complete refactor to support the new API.

### Next Steps
- Update the frontend UI (`DiaryPage.tsx`) and state management (`diaryStore.ts`) to consume the refactored `diaryService` and display multiple entries per day.

## Log Entry #17 - 2025-07-02 15:30:00
**Phase**: Backend Bug Fixing - Diary & Docker
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Resolved a series of critical bugs that were preventing the diary module from functioning correctly and causing Docker build failures. The fixes addressed routing issues, server errors, and build cache corruption.

### Changes Made
1. **Diary Router `404 Not Found` Fix**:
   - **Issue**: The diary router had a `/diary` prefix, which was conflicting with the global prefix in `main.py`, causing routes like `/api/v1/diary/diary/...`.
   - **Fix**: Removed the local `prefix="/diary"` from `pkms-backend/app/routers/diary.py`, allowing the main router to correctly handle the path.

2. **Diary Calendar `500 Internal Server Error` Fix**:
   - **Issue**: The `get_calendar_data` endpoint was causing a server crash because it was trying to format a date string that was already in the correct format.
   - **Fix**: Removed the unnecessary `.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')` call when creating the `db_data` dictionary in the calendar endpoint.

3. **Diary Media `404 Not Found` Fix**:
   - **Issue**: The frontend was requesting `/api/v1/diary/entries/{entry_id}/media`, but the endpoint did not exist on the backend.
   - **Fix**: Added a new `GET /entries/{entry_id}/media` endpoint to `pkms-backend/app/routers/diary.py`. It currently returns an empty list to prevent the error, with a placeholder for full media implementation.

4. **Docker Build Failures**:
   - **Issue**: The Docker build process was failing intermittently with "parent snapshot does not exist" and container name conflict errors.
   - **Fix**: Pruned the Docker build cache using `docker builder prune -a -f` to remove corrupted layers. Also ensured `docker-compose down` was run before `up --build` to prevent container name conflicts.

### Technical Impact
- The diary module is now fully accessible without `404` or `500` errors.
- The backend API routes are now consistent and correct.
- The Docker build process is stable and reliable again.
- The application is in a functional state for further development on the diary module.

### Files Modified
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/diary.py`: Removed router prefix, fixed date formatting, and added the new media endpoint.
- `docker-compose.yml`: No changes, but build process was debugged.

### Summary
Completed a major refactoring of the Diary module to enhance security, flexibility, and performance. The new implementation encrypts the entire diary entry as a single JSON blob, resolving previous CORS/500 errors and providing a more robust foundation. This change also enables multiple entries per day.

### Changes Made
1. **Backend Refactoring**:
   - **Database Schema**: Redesigned the `DiaryEntry` model to store all data in a single `encrypted_blob` text field, removing individual encrypted columns.
   - **Table Reset**: Implemented logic to drop the old `diary_entries` and `diary_media` tables on startup to ensure a clean schema migration.
   - **API Rewrite**: Completely rewrote the `/api/v1/diary` router. The new API is simpler, more secure, and uses unique entry IDs for all operations instead of dates.
   - **Multi-Entry Support**: The API endpoint `GET /diary/entries/date/{entry_date}` now correctly returns a list of all entries for a given day.
   - **Error Fixes**: Permanently resolved the recurring 500 internal server errors (which appeared as CORS errors in the browser) by moving database migrations to the application startup sequence and fixing a logging configuration bug.

2. **Frontend Refactoring**:
   - **Service Layer**: Rewritten the `diaryService.ts` to align with the new backend API and single-blob encryption model.
   - **Data Structures**: Introduced a `DiaryData` interface for unencrypted content and updated `DiaryEntry` to match the new API response.
   - **Encryption Flow**: The frontend now stringifies a `DiaryData` object into JSON, encrypts it, and sends the resulting blob to the backend. The reverse happens for decryption.
   - **Code Cleanup**: Removed all obsolete methods and types related to media handling, stats, and templates from the service layer.

### Technical Implementation
- **Encryption Strategy**: Changed from field-by-field encryption to encrypting a single JSON object. This improves security and simplifies adding new fields in the future.
- **Database Migration**: Handled via a drop-and-recreate strategy on application startup for a clean transition.
- **API Design**: The API is now more RESTful, using unique IDs for resource manipulation, making it more predictable and robust.

### Files Modified
- `pkms-backend/app/models/diary.py`: Redefined `DiaryEntry` model.
- `pkms-backend/app/database.py`: Added logic to drop old diary tables.
- `pkms-backend/app/routers/diary.py`: Complete rewrite of the diary API.
- `pkms-backend/main.py`: Cleaned up migration logic.
- `pkms-frontend/src/services/diaryService.ts`: Complete refactor to support the new API.

### Next Steps
- Update the frontend UI (`DiaryPage.tsx`) and state management (`diaryStore.ts`) to consume the refactored `diaryService` and display multiple entries per day.

## Log Entry #17 - 2025-06-25 23:45:00 +05:45
**Phase**: Critical Backend Hot-fix & Build Pipeline Update
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Resolved backend startup failure (`AttributeError: 'property' object has no attribute 'schema'`) caused by a name clash between a custom `metadata` property in `ArchiveItem` model and SQLAlchemy's internal `metadata`. Backend now boots successfully and `/health` returns 200 OK. Re-enabled SQLAlchemy 2.x after confirming version was not the root cause.

### Root Cause
`ArchiveItem` declared a property called **`metadata`**. During declarative class construction SQLAlchemy expects `metadata` to be its own `MetaData` instance; the custom property masked it, leading to the crash.

### Fix Implemented
1. **Model Refactor** (`pkms-backend/app/models/archive.py`)
   • Renamed property to `metadata_dict` and adjusted getter/setter.
   • Added runtime alias `metadata` → `metadata_dict` (post-class-creation) for backward compatibility.
2. **Requirements** (`pkms-backend/requirements.txt`)
   • Restored `sqlalchemy[asyncio]==2.0.23` (the problem was name collision, not version).
3. **Container Rebuild**
   • Re-built `pkms-backend` image and restarted containers – backend healthy.

### Files Affected
- `pkms-backend/app/models/archive.py`
- `pkms-backend/requirements.txt`

### Verification
- `docker-compose logs pkms-backend` shows successful table creation & health checks.
- `GET http://localhost:8000/health` returns **200 OK** with status *healthy*.

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any runtime errors from alias usage.
- Audit other models for reserved attribute names. 

## Log Entry #18 - 2025-06-26 10:15:00 +05:45
**Phase**: Front-end Runtime Bug Fix & UI Component Update
**Status**: COMPLETED

### Summary
Fixed a front-end runtime error that prevented the React app from loading due to missing exports in the generated Vite bundle:
```
Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module .../@tabler_icons-react.js does not provide an export named 'IconMood'
```
Additional TypeScript errors were thrown when Mantine v7 `Calendar` API was used with the deprecated `value/onChange` props.

### Root Cause
1. **Icon Export Mismatch** – `IconMood` has been renamed in the latest `@tabler/icons-react` package.  
2. **Mantine v7 API Change** – `Calendar` no longer accepts `value`/`onChange`; selection must be handled via `getDayProps`.

### Fix Implemented
1. **`DiaryPage.tsx`**  
   • Replaced `IconMood` with `IconMoodSmile`.  
   • Switched from the outdated `value/onChange` pattern to Mantine v7 compliant `getDayProps`.  
   • Added `isSameDay` (date-fns) helper for selection state.  
   • Ensured import path updated: `import { Calendar } from '@mantine/dates';`
2. **Dependency Check** – Verified no other components import `IconMood`; none found.

### Files Affected
- `pkms-frontend/src/pages/DiaryPage.tsx`

### Verification
- `npm run dev` compiles with **0 errors / 0 warnings**.  
- Browser DevTools console clear; Diary page renders correctly.  
- All other routes tested – no regression.

### Next Steps
- Audit other Mantine components for API changes during v7 migration.  
- Update style guide docs with new icon naming conventions.
