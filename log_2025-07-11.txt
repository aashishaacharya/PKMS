Log #86: Recovery API – Optional Username Fallback (Single-User Mode)
Date: July 11, 2025, 5:10 PM (+05:45)
Author: o3 via Cursor
==================================================

Summary
• Made `username` parameter optional for `/auth/recovery/questions` and `/auth/recovery/reset`.
• Backend now auto-selects the sole user when username is omitted; if multiple users exist it returns 400 requiring username.
• Keeps multi-user safety and restores compatibility with existing React UI (which sends no username).

Files Affected
1. pkms-backend/app/routers/auth.py – Updated `RecoveryReset` model and both recovery endpoints (~20 LOC).

Impact
• Front-end recovery modal works again (no 422 errors).
• Multi-user installations remain protected.

Log #87: Removed Diary Password Strength Requirements
Date: July 11, 2025, 6:05 PM (+05:45)
Author: o3 via Cursor
==================================================

Summary
• Diary password complexity checks removed – users can set any password (only unsafe character sanitisation remains).
• Registration no longer returns errors like "Password must contain uppercase letter" for diary passwords.
• Main login password strength policy remains unchanged for security.

Files Affected
1. pkms-backend/app/routers/auth.py – Removed validation check (~8 LOC).

Impact
• Simplified UX: Users can choose simple diary passwords if desired.
• Security note: Diary content encryption relies on user-chosen password; weak passwords reduce cryptographic protection.
