# Requirements Document - PKMS Codebase Analysis & Improvement

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive analysis of the PKMS (Personal Knowledge Management System) codebase to identify issues, improvements, and create detailed feature-specific analysis documents. The system is a full-stack application built with FastAPI (backend) and React (frontend) that manages notes, documents, todos, diary entries, and archives.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete analysis of the PKMS codebase, so that I can understand the current state, identify issues, and plan improvements effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL examine all major modules (Notes, Documents, Todos, Diary, Archive, Authentication, Search)
2. WHEN conducting the analysis THEN the system SHALL identify architectural patterns, code quality issues, and technical debt
3. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL assess security implementations, performance bottlenecks, and maintainability concerns
4. WHEN examining dependencies THEN the system SHALL evaluate version compatibility, security vulnerabilities, and optimization opportunities

### Requirement 2: Feature-Specific Analysis Documents

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed analysis documents for each major feature, so that I can understand the implementation details and identify specific improvements for each module.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating feature analysis THEN the system SHALL generate separate documents for each major module
2. WHEN analyzing each feature THEN the system SHALL document current implementation, identified issues, and improvement recommendations
3. WHEN documenting features THEN the system SHALL include code examples, architectural diagrams, and specific action items
4. WHEN reviewing features THEN the system SHALL assess both frontend and backend implementations

### Requirement 3: Issue Identification and Prioritization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want identified issues to be categorized and prioritized, so that I can focus on the most critical problems first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL categorize them as Critical, High, Medium, or Low priority
2. WHEN documenting issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear descriptions, impact assessment, and recommended solutions
3. WHEN prioritizing issues THEN the system SHALL consider security, performance, maintainability, and user experience factors
4. WHEN listing issues THEN the system SHALL include estimated effort and implementation complexity

### Requirement 4: Improvement Recommendations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want specific improvement recommendations, so that I can enhance the codebase systematically and effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest specific code changes, architectural improvements, and best practices
2. WHEN recommending improvements THEN the system SHALL consider modern development practices, security standards, and performance optimization
3. WHEN suggesting changes THEN the system SHALL provide implementation guidance and potential risks
4. WHEN documenting improvements THEN the system SHALL include before/after examples and expected benefits

### Requirement 5: Technical Debt Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand the technical debt in the system, so that I can plan refactoring efforts and prevent future issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing technical debt THEN the system SHALL identify code duplication, inconsistent patterns, and outdated practices
2. WHEN documenting debt THEN the system SHALL quantify the impact on maintainability and development velocity
3. WHEN analyzing debt THEN the system SHALL provide refactoring strategies and migration paths
4. WHEN reporting debt THEN the system SHALL include metrics and measurable improvement goals

### Requirement 6: Security Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a thorough security analysis, so that I can ensure the system protects user data and prevents vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting security analysis THEN the system SHALL review authentication, authorization, and data protection mechanisms
2. WHEN examining security THEN the system SHALL identify potential vulnerabilities, insecure practices, and compliance gaps
3. WHEN documenting security THEN the system SHALL provide specific remediation steps and security best practices
4. WHEN assessing security THEN the system SHALL evaluate both frontend and backend security implementations

### Requirement 7: Performance Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand performance characteristics, so that I can optimize the system for better user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks in database queries, API endpoints, and frontend rendering
2. WHEN examining performance THEN the system SHALL assess caching strategies, optimization opportunities, and resource usage
3. WHEN documenting performance THEN the system SHALL provide specific optimization recommendations and expected improvements
4. WHEN reviewing performance THEN the system SHALL consider scalability and resource efficiency

### Requirement 8: Documentation Quality Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to evaluate documentation quality, so that I can improve knowledge transfer and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing documentation THEN the system SHALL review code comments, API documentation, and setup guides
2. WHEN examining documentation THEN the system SHALL identify gaps, inconsistencies, and outdated information
3. WHEN documenting quality THEN the system SHALL provide recommendations for improving documentation standards
4. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL assess completeness, accuracy, and usefulness
