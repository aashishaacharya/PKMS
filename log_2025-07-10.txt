**Phase**: Archive Module UI/Data Consistency & Single-Upload Simplification  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**AI Assistant**: o3 GPT-4 via Cursor

### Summary
Implemented end-to-end improvements for the Archive module:
1. Restored shared `coreUploadService` chunked-upload flow while removing multi-select uploads.
2. Added automatic item listing for the selected folder on the Archive page.
3. Introduced optimistic UI updates & granular loading states.
4. Strengthened type-safety between service, store, and UI layers.

### Key Changes
| Layer | File | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Frontend Service | `pkms-frontend/src/services/archiveService.ts` | Added `getFolderItems`; refined `uploadFile` |
| Frontend Store   | `pkms-frontend/src/stores/archiveStore.ts`   | Added `loadItems`, `isLoadingItems`; optimistic uploads; async `setCurrentFolder` |
| Frontend UI      | `pkms-frontend/src/pages/ArchivePage.tsx`    | New 2-column layout, file grid, loaders & empty-state UI |

### UX Enhancements
- Selecting a folder now fetches & displays its files.
- Upload progress (simple or chunked) shown with animated bar.
- Newly uploaded file appears instantly without full refresh.
- Clear loader & empty-folder messaging improve usability.

### Files Affected
1. `pkms-frontend/src/services/archiveService.ts`
2. `pkms-frontend/src/stores/archiveStore.ts`
3. `pkms-frontend/src/pages/ArchivePage.tsx`

_No backend changes were required; existing `GET /folders/{folder_uuid}/items/` endpoint is utilized._
